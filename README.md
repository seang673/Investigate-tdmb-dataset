# Investigate-tdmb-dataset

## Description
I imported a dataset into Jupyter Notebook detailing basic information on over 10000 TMDb movies. I incorporated key data wrangling and data cleaning techniques to analyze and adjust our data. I then sought out the answers about two research questions pertaining to the data. 

## Research Questions
* What correlations are there betwee different numerical columns and movie revenue?
* How does revenue change over the years?
